~~## End of development
After 3 years of working on this mod I've decided that it's time to say goodbye to it, the mod might get some bug fixes if people are interested but nothing actual new.~~
Update whenever I feel like it ;)

## What is HoloUI? ##
HoloUI is a UI mod that changes most of the UI design of the game to look more modern, it's also highly customizable!

## What is in this fork?
Support for the burstfire mod.
That comes with the sacrifice of the fire indicator is now A(uto), S(ingle), and B(urst) instead of dots.

## Features ##
 - Changes the design of payday 2's UI almost entirely.
 - A better chat with scrolling, copy pasting and site links support.
 - HUD Scaling & Spacing option!
 - The mod is built in a way that is less likely to break with each update.
 - Very customizable UI with a lot of options to play with!
